HAProxy documentation
=====================

This is an effort to give documentation for HAProxy to usable form.
I found google code wiki version [here](http://code.google.com/p/haproxy-docs/) but I don't know version, it should be outdated.

The document available here is machine created by converting the original documentation.

Version 1.5
