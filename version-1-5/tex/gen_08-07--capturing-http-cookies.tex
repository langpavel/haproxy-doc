\section{Capturing HTTP cookies}

Cookie capture simplifies the tracking a complete user session. This can be
achieved using the \emph{capture cookie} statement in the frontend. Please refer to
section 4.2 for more details. Only one cookie can be captured, and the same
cookie will simultaneously be checked in the request ("Cookie:" header) and in
the response ("Set-Cookie:" header). The respective values will be reported in
the HTTP logs at the \emph{captured\_request\_cookie} and \emph{captured\_response\_cookie}
locations (see section 8.2.3 about HTTP log format). When either cookie is
not seen, a dash \CHAR{-} replaces the value. This way, it's easy to detect when a
user switches to a new session for example, because the server will reassign it
a new cookie. It is also possible to detect if a server unexpectedly sets a
wrong cookie to a client, leading to session crossing.

\begin{verbatim}
  Examples :
        # capture the first cookie whose name starts with "ASPSESSION"
        capture cookie ASPSESSION len 32
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
        # capture the first cookie whose name is exactly "vgnvisitor"
        capture cookie vgnvisitor= len 32
\end{verbatim}
