\section{Configuration file format}

HAProxy's configuration process involves 3 major sources of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item the arguments from the command-line, which always take precedence
\item the \keyword{global} section, which sets process-wide parameters
\item the proxies sections which can take form of \keyword{defaults}, 
	\keyword{listen}, \keyword{frontend} and \keyword{backend}.
\end{itemize}

The configuration file syntax consists in lines beginning with a keyword
referenced in this manual, optionally followed by one or several parameters
delimited by spaces. If spaces have to be entered in strings, then they must be
preceded by a backslash \CHAR{\bslash} to be escaped. Backslashes also have to be
escaped by doubling them.
