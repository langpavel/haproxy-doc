%The summary below is meant to help you search sections by name and navigate
%through the document.

%Note to documentation contributors :
%    This document is formated with 80 columns per line, with even number of
%    spaces for indentation and without tabs. Please follow these rules strictly
%    so that it remains easily printable everywhere. If a line needs to be
%    printed verbatim and does not fit, please end each line with a backslash
%    ('\') and continue on next line, indented by two characters. It is also
%    sometimes useful to prefix all output lines (logs, console outs) with 3
%    closing angle brackets ('>>>') in order to help get the difference between
%    inputs and outputs when it can become ambiguous. If you add sections,
%    please update the summary below for easier searching.
