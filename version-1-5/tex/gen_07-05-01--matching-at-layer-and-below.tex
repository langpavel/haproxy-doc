\subsection{Matching at Layer 4 and below}

A first set of criteria applies to information which does not require any
analysis of the request or response contents. Those generally include TCP/IP
addresses and ports, as well as internal values independant on the stream.

\begin{verbatim}
  This one never matches. All values and flags are ignored. It may be used as
  a temporary replacement for another one when adjusting configurations.

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
avg_queue <integer>
avg_queue(<backend>) <integer>
  Returns the total number of queued connections of the designated backend
  divided by the number of active servers. This is very similar to "queue"
  except that the size of the farm is considered, in order to give a more
  accurate measurement of the time it may take for a new connection to be
  processed. The main usage is to return a sorry page to new users when it
  becomes certain they will get a degraded service. Note that in the event
  there would not be any active server anymore, we would consider twice the
  number of queued connections as the measured value. This is a fair estimate,
  as we expect one server to get back soon anyway, but we still prefer to send
  new traffic to another backend if in better shape. See also the "queue",
  "be_conn", and "be_sess_rate" criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
be_conn <integer>
be_conn(<backend>) <integer>
  Applies to the number of currently established connections on the backend,
  possibly including the connection being evaluated. If no backend name is
  specified, the current one is used. But it is also possible to check another
  backend. It can be used to use a specific farm when the nominal one is full.
  See also the "fe_conn", "queue" and "be_sess_rate" criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
be_id <integer>
  Applies to the backend's id. Can be used in frontends to check from which
  backend it was called.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
be_sess_rate <integer>
be_sess_rate(<backend>) <integer>
  Returns true when the sessions creation rate on the backend matches the
  specified values or ranges, in number of new sessions per second. This is
  used to switch to an alternate backend when an expensive or fragile one
  reaches too high a session rate, or to limit abuse of service (eg. prevent
  sucking of an online dictionary).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Example :
        # Redirect to an error page if the dictionary is requested too often
        backend dynamic
            mode http
            acl being_scanned be_sess_rate gt 100
            redirect location /denied.html if being_scanned
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
connslots <integer>
connslots(<backend>) <integer>
  The basic idea here is to be able to measure the number of connection "slots"
  still available (connection + queue), so that anything beyond that (intended
  usage; see "use_backend" keyword) can be redirected to a different backend.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  'connslots' = number of available server connection slots, + number of
  available server queue slots.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Note that while "fe_conn" may be used, "connslots" comes in especially
  useful when you have a case of traffic going to one single ip, splitting into
  multiple backends (perhaps using acls to do name-based load balancing) and
  you want to be able to differentiate between different backends, and their
  available "connslots".  Also, whereas "nbsrv" only measures servers that are
  actually *down*, this acl is more fine-grained and looks into the number of
  available connection slots as well. See also "queue" and "avg_queue".
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  OTHER CAVEATS AND NOTES: at this point in time, the code does not take care
  of dynamic connections. Also, if any of the server maxconn, or maxqueue is 0,
  then this acl clearly does not make sense, in which case the value returned
  will be -1.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
dst <ip_address>
  Applies to the local IPv4 address the client connected to. It can be used to
  switch to a different backend for some alternative addresses.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
dst_conn <integer>
  Applies to the number of currently established connections on the same socket
  including the one being evaluated. It can be used to either return a sorry
  page before hard-blocking, or to use a specific backend to drain new requests
  when the socket is considered saturated. This offers the ability to assign
  different limits to different listening ports or addresses. See also the
  "fe_conn" and "be_conn" criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
dst_port <integer>
  Applies to the local port the client connected to. It can be used to switch
  to a different backend for some alternative ports.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
fe_conn <integer>
fe_conn(<frontend>) <integer>
  Applies to the number of currently established connections on the frontend,
  possibly including the connection being evaluated. If no frontend name is
  specified, the current one is used. But it is also possible to check another
  frontend. It can be used to either return a sorry page before hard-blocking,
  or to use a specific backend to drain new requests when the farm is
  considered saturated. See also the "dst_conn", "be_conn" and "fe_sess_rate"
  criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
fe_id <integer>
  Applies to the frontend's id. Can be used in backends to check from which
  frontend it was called.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
fe_sess_rate <integer>
fe_sess_rate(<frontend>) <integer>
  Returns true when the session creation rate on the current or the named
  frontend matches the specified values or ranges, expressed in new sessions
  per second. This is used to limit the connection rate to acceptable ranges in
  order to prevent abuse of service at the earliest moment. This can be
  combined with layer 4 ACLs in order to force the clients to wait a bit for
  the rate to go down below the limit.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Example :
        # This frontend limits incoming mails to 10/s with a max of 100
        # concurrent connections. We accept any connection below 10/s, and
        # force excess clients to wait for 100 ms. Since clients are limited to
        # 100 max, there cannot be more than 10 incoming mails per second.
        frontend mail
            bind :25
            mode tcp
            maxconn 100
            acl too_fast fe_sess_rate ge 10
            tcp-request inspect-delay 100ms
            tcp-request content accept if ! too_fast
            tcp-request content accept if WAIT_END
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
nbsrv <integer>
nbsrv(<backend>) <integer>
  Returns true when the number of usable servers of either the current backend
  or the named backend matches the values or ranges specified. This is used to
  switch to an alternate backend when the number of servers is too low to
  to handle some load. It is useful to report a failure when combined with
  "monitor fail".
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
queue <integer>
queue(<backend>) <integer>
  Returns the total number of queued connections of the designated backend,
  including all the connections in server queues. If no backend name is
  specified, the current one is used, but it is also possible to check another
  one. This can be used to take actions when queuing goes above a known level,
  generally indicating a surge of traffic or a massive slowdown on the servers.
  One possible action could be to reject new users but still accept old ones.
  See also the "avg_queue", "be_conn", and "be_sess_rate" criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average client-to-server bytes rate from the currently tracked
  counters, measured in amount of bytes over the period configured in the
  table. See also src_bytes_in_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average server-to-client bytes rate from the currently tracked
  counters, measured in amount of bytes over the period configured in the
  table. See also src_bytes_out_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Clears the first General Purpose Counter associated to the currently tracked
  counters, and returns its previous value. Before the first invocation, the
  stored value is zero, so first invocation will always return zero. The test
  can also be used alone and always returns true. This is typically used as a
  second ACL in an expression in order to mark a connection when a first ACL
  was verified :
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
        # block if 5 consecutive requests continue to come faster than 10 sess
        # per second, and reset the counter as soon as the traffic slows down.
        acl abuse sc1_http_req_rate gt 10
        acl kill  sc1_inc_gpc0 gt 5
        acl save  sc1_clr_gpc0
        tcp-request connection accept if !abuse save
        tcp-request connection reject if abuse kill
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the cumulated number of incoming connections from currently tracked
  counters. See also src_conn_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the current amount of concurrent connections tracking the same
  tracked counters. This number is automatically incremented when tracking
  begins and decremented when tracking stops. See also src_conn_cur.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average connection rate from the currently tracked counters,
  measured in amount of connections over the period configured in the table.
  See also src_conn_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the value of the first General Purpose Counter associated to the
  currently tracked counters. See also src_get_gpc0 and sc1/sc2_inc_gpc0.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the cumulated number of HTTP errors from the currently tracked
  counters. This includes the both request errors and 4xx error responses.
  See also src_http_err_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average rate of HTTP errors from the currently tracked counters,
  measured in amount of errors over the period configured in the table. This
  includes the both request errors and 4xx error responses. See also
  src_http_err_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the cumulated number of HTTP requests from the currently tracked
  counters. This includes every started request, valid or not. See also
  src_http_req_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average rate of HTTP requests from the currently tracked
  counters, measured in amount of requests over the period configured in
  the table. This includes every started request, valid or not. See also
  src_http_req_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Increments the first General Purpose Counter associated to the currently
  tracked counters, and returns its value. Before the first invocation, the
  stored value is zero, so first invocation will increase it to 1 and will
  return 1. The test can also be used alone and always returns true. This is
  typically used as a second ACL in an expression in order to mark a connection
  when a first ACL was verified :
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
        acl abuse sc1_http_req_rate gt 10
        acl kill  sc1_inc_gpc0
        tcp-request connection reject if abuse kill
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the amount of client-to-server data from the currently tracked
  counters, measured in kilobytes over the period configured in the table. The
  test is currently performed on 32-bit integers, which limits values to 4
  terabytes. See also src_kbytes_in.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the amount of server-to-client data from the currently tracked
  counters, measured in kilobytes over the period configured in the table. The
  test is currently performed on 32-bit integers, which limits values to 4
  terabytes. See also src_kbytes_out.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the cumulated number of incoming connections that were transformed
  into sessions, which means that they were accepted by a "tcp-request
  connection" rule, from the currently tracked counters. A backend may count
  more sessions than connections because each connection could result in many
  backend sessions if some HTTP keep-alive is performend over the connection
  with the client. See also src_sess_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Returns the average session rate from the currently tracked counters,
  measured in amount of sessions over the period configured in the table. A
  session is a connection that got past the early "tcp-request connection"
  rules. A backend may count more sessions than connections because each
  connection could result in many backend sessions if some HTTP keep-alive is
  performend over the connection with the client. See also src_sess_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
so_id <integer>
  Applies to the socket's id. Useful in frontends with many bind keywords.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src <ip_address>
  Applies to the client's IPv4 address. It is usually used to limit access to
  certain resources such as statistics. Note that it is the TCP-level source
  address which is used, and not the address of a client behind a proxy.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_bytes_in_rate <integer>
src_bytes_in_rate(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the average bytes rate from the connection's source IPv4 address in
  the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated stick-table, measured in
  amount of bytes over the period configured in the table. If the address is
  not found, zero is returned. See also sc1/sc2_bytes_in_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_bytes_out_rate <integer>
src_bytes_out_rate(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the average bytes rate to the connection's source IPv4 address in the
  current proxy's stick-table or in the designated stick-table, measured in
  amount of bytes over the period configured in the table. If the address is
  not found, zero is returned. See also sc1/sc2_bytes_out_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_clr_gpc0 <integer>
src_clr_gpc0(<table>) <integer>
  Clears the first General Purpose Counter associated to the connection's
  source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated
  stick-table, and returns its previous value. If the address is not found, an
  entry is created and 0 is returned. The test can also be used alone and
  always returns true. This is typically used as a second ACL in an expression
  in order to mark a connection when a first ACL was verified :
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
        # block if 5 consecutive requests continue to come faster than 10 sess
        # per second, and reset the counter as soon as the traffic slows down.
        acl abuse src_http_req_rate gt 10
        acl kill  src_inc_gpc0 gt 5

src_conn_cur(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the current amount of concurrent connections initiated from the
  current connection's source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table
  or in the designated stick-table. If the address is not found, zero is

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_get_gpc0 <integer>
src_get_gpc0(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the value of the first General Purpose Counter associated to the
  connection's source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in
  the designated stick-table. If the address is not found, zero is returned.
  See also sc1/sc2_get_gpc0 and src_inc_gpc0.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}

src_http_err_cnt(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the cumulated number of HTTP errors from the current connection's
  source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated

  Returns the average rate of HTTP requests from the current connection's
  source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated
  stick-table, measured in amount of requests over the period configured in the
  table. This includes every started request, valid or not. If the address is
  not found, zero is returned. See also sc1/sc2_http_req_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_inc_gpc0 <integer>
src_inc_gpc0(<table>) <integer>
  Increments the first General Purpose Counter associated to the connection's
  source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated
  stick-table, and returns its value. If the address is not found, an entry is
  created and 1 is returned. The test can also be used alone and always returns
  true. This is typically used as a second ACL in an expression in order to
  mark a connection when a first ACL was verified :
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
        acl abuse src_http_req_rate gt 10
        acl kill  src_inc_gpc0
        tcp-request connection reject if abuse kill
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_kbytes_in <integer>
src_kbytes_in(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the amount of data received from the connection's source IPv4 address
  in the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated stick-table, measured
  in kilobytes over the period configured in the table. If the address is not
  found, zero is returned. The test is currently performed on 32-bit integers,
  which limits values to 4 terabytes. See also sc1/sc2_kbytes_in.
\end{verbatim}

  which limits values to 4 terabytes. See also sc1/sc2_kbytes_out.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_port <integer>

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_sess_cnt <integer>
src_sess_cnt(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the cumulated number of connections initiated from the current
  connection's source IPv4 address in the current proxy's stick-table or in the
  designated stick-table, that were transformed into sessions, which means that
  they were accepted by "tcp-request" rules. If the address is not found, zero
  is returned. See also sc1/sc2_sess_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_sess_rate <integer>
src_sess_rate(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the average session rate from the connection's source IPv4 address in
  the current proxy's stick-table or in the designated stick-table, measured in
  amount of sessions over the period configured in the table. A session is a
  connection that got past the early "tcp-request" rules. If the address is not
  found, zero is returned. See also sc1/sc2_sess_rate.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
src_updt_conn_cnt <integer>
src_updt_conn_cnt(<table>) <integer>
  Creates or updates the entry associated to the source IPv4 address in the
  current proxy's stick-table or in the designated stick-table. This table
  must be configured to store the "conn_cnt" data type, otherwise the match
  will be ignored. The current count is incremented by one, and the expiration
  timer refreshed. The updated count is returned, so this match can't return
  zero. This is used to reject service abusers based on their source address.
  Note: it is recommended to use the more complete "track-counters" instead.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
  Example :
        # This frontend limits incoming SSH connections to 3 per 10 second for
        # each source address, and rejects excess connections until a 10 second
        # silence is observed. At most 20 addresses are tracked.
        listen ssh
            bind :22
            mode tcp
            maxconn 100
            stick-table type ip size 20 expire 10s store conn_cnt
            tcp-request content reject if { src_update_count gt 3 }
            server local 127.0.0.1:22
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
srv_conn(<backend>/<server>) <integer>
  Applies to the number of currently established connections on the server,
  possibly including the connection being evaluated.
  It can be used to use a specific farm when one server is full.
  See also the "fe_conn", "be_conn" and "queue" criteria.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
srv_id <integer>
  Applies to the server's id. Can be used in frontends or backends.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
srv_is_up(<server>)
srv_is_up(<backend>/<server>)
  Returns true when the designated server is UP, and false when it is either
  DOWN or in maintenance mode. If <backend> is omitted, then the server is
  looked up in the current backend. The function takes no arguments since it
  is used as a boolean. It is mainly used to take action based on an external
  status reported via a health check (eg: a geographical site's availability).
  Another possible use which is more of a hack consists in using dummy servers
  as boolean variables that can be enabled or disabled from the CLI, so that
  rules depending on those ACLs can be tweaked in realtime.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
table_avl <integer>
table_avl(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the total number of available entries in the current proxy's
  stick-table or in the designated stick-table. See also table_cnt.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
table_cnt <integer>
table_cnt(<table>) <integer>
  Returns the total number of entries currently in use in the current proxy's
  stick-table or in the designated stick-table. See also src_conn_cnt and
  table_avl for other entry counting methods.
\end{verbatim}
