\begin{keywords}

\kw{debug} \ 

  Enables debug mode which dumps to stdout all exchanges, and disables forking
  into background. It is the equivalent of the command-line argument \cmdarg{-d}.
  It should never be used in a production configuration since it may prevent full
  system startup.

\kw{quiet} \ 

  Do not display any message during startup. It is equivalent to the
  command-line argument \cmdarg{-q}.
