\section{Log levels}

TCP and HTTP connections can be logged with information such as the date, time,
source IP address, destination address, connection duration, response times,
HTTP request, HTTP return code, number of bytes transmitted, conditions
in which the session ended, and even exchanged cookies values. For example
track a particular user's problems. All messages may be sent to up to two
syslog servers. Check the \emph{log} keyword in section 4.2 for more information
about log facilities.
