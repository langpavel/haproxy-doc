\section{Time format}

Some parameters involve values representing time, such as timeouts. These
values are generally expressed in milliseconds (unless explicitly stated
otherwise) but may be expressed in any other unit by suffixing the unit to the
numeric value. It is important to consider this because it will not be repeated
for every keyword. Supported units are:

\begin{tabbing}
\qquad\=\CHAR{us}\quad\= microseconds\quad\= $1\,\mu s = 10^{-6}\,s = \nicefrac{1}{\numprint{1000000}}\,s$\\
\>\CHAR{ms} \> milliseconds\> $1\,ms = 10^{-3}\,s = \nicefrac{1}{\numprint{1000}}\,s$. \em{This is the default.}\\
\>\CHAR{s}  \> seconds\>  $1\,s = \numprint{1000}\,ms$\\
\>\CHAR{m}  \> minutes\>  $1\,m = 60\,s = \numprint{60000}\,ms$\\
\>\CHAR{h}  \> hours\>    $1\,h = 60\,m = \numprint{3600}\,s = \numprint{3600000}\,ms$\\
\>\CHAR{d}  \> days\>     $1\,d = 24\,h = \numprint{1440}\,m = \numprint{86400}\,s = \numprint{86400000}\,ms$\\
\end{tabbing}
