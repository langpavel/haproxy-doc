\section{Matching strings}

String matching applies to verbatim strings as they are passed, with the
exception of the backslash ("\bslash ") which makes it possible to escape some
characters such as the space. If the \cmdarg{-i} flag is passed before the first
string, then the matching will be performed ignoring the case. In order
to match the string \cmdarg{-i}, either set it second, or pass the \cmdarg{--} flag
before the first string. Same applies of course to match the string \cmdarg{--}.
