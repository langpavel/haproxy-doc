\section{Non-printable characters}

In order not to cause trouble to log analysis tools or terminals during log
consulting, non-printable characters are not sent as-is into log files, but are
converted to the two-digits hexadecimal representation of their ASCII code,
prefixed by the character \CHAR{\#}. The only characters that can be logged without
being escaped are comprised between 32 and 126 (inclusive). Obviously, the
escape character \CHAR{\#} itself is also encoded to avoid any ambiguity ("\#23"). It
is the same for the character \CHAR{"} which becomes "\#22", as well as \CHAR{\{',~}|' and
\CHAR{\}} when logging headers.


Note that the space character \CHAR{~} is not encoded in headers, which can cause
issues for tools relying on space count to locate fields. A typical header
containing spaces is "User-Agent".


Last, it has been observed that some syslog daemons such as syslog-ng escape
the quote \CHAR{"} with a backslash ('\bslash '). The reverse operation can safely be
performed since no quote may appear anywhere else in the logs.
