\section{Matching regular expressions (regexes)}

Just like with string matching, regex matching applies to verbatim strings as
they are passed, with the exception of the backslash ("\bslash ") which makes it
possible to escape some characters such as the space. If the \cmdarg{-i} flag is
passed before the first regex, then the matching will be performed ignoring
the case. In order to match the string \cmdarg{-i}, either set it second, or pass
the \cmdarg{--} flag before the first string. Same principle applies of course to
match the string \cmdarg{--}.
