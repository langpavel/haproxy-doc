\subsection{Disabling logging of successful connections}

Although this may sound strange at first, some large sites have to deal with
multiple thousands of logs per second and are experiencing difficulties keeping
them intact for a long time or detecting errors within them. If the option
"dontlog-normal" is set on the frontend, all normal connections will not be
logged. In this regard, a normal connection is defined as one without any
error, timeout, retry nor redispatch. In HTTP, the status code is checked too,
and a response with a status 5xx is not considered normal and will be logged
too. Of course, doing is is really discouraged as it will remove most of the
useful information from the logs. Do this only if you have no other
alternative.
